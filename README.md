Using https://omdbapi.com/ API, create an app that does search for all titles matching user input and displays UI based on output from said API.

You will need an API key that you will receive by registering on the page.

Technical requirements:
- Built using React (CRA is fine), TypeScript and Styled Components;
- Build version publicly available;
- Repository is publicly available;
- Styling is up to the candidate;
- Description of the approach is a plus.

Treat this as a production-grade application.
